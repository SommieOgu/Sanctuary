# Elevator Pitch

Sanctuary is a web app designed to provide a safe, supportive space for individuals experiencing domestic abuse. Every year, 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men experience severe intimate partner violence in the United States alone.  Using the power of Google AI, Sanctuary intelligently locates and recommends nearby shelters, helping users find safety as quickly and easily as possible. Whether you need shelter, support, or simply a moment of security, Sanctuary delivers real-time, accessible resources when you need them most.

# Usage Tips & Known Limitations
## Location Services:
Make sure your browser's location services are enabled for the most accurate shelter recommendations.

## Data Accuracy:
Our recommendations are based on currently available shelter data and may not always reflect real-time changes. We're actively working to improve the accuracy and reliability of our listings.

## Performance:
Occasionally, the AI-powered matching system may take a little time to find the best shelter options. Thank you for your patience as we continue to optimize the platform.

## Known Limitations:

Shelter data may be incomplete or unavailable in certain regions.

AI recommendations are still being improved and may not always suggest the ideal shelter immediately.

For urgent assistance, we recommend contacting local shelters or emergency services directly.
