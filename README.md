#Elevator Pitch
Sanctuary is a web app that provides a safe space for individuals experiencing domestic abuse by helping them find nearby shelters. Powered by Google AI, Sanctuary uses intelligent algorithms to pinpoint the best shelters close to usersâ€™ locations, ensuring that those in need can get help as quickly as possible. Whether you're looking for shelter, support, or safety, Sanctuary is here to help with accessible, real-time data.

#Usage Tips & Known Limitations
Location Services: Ensure that your browser's location services are enabled for the best shelter recommendations.

Data Accuracy: The shelter recommendations are based on available data and may not always reflect the most up-to-date information. We're working on continuously improving the data source and recommendations.

Performance: Due to the AI-powered matching system, the app may occasionally experience delays in finding the best shelters. Please be patient, and know that we are working to optimize performance.

Known Limitations:

Some shelter data may not be available in certain regions or may have inaccuracies. We recommend reaching out to your local shelter or services directly if you experience issues.

The AI-powered matching system is still in development and may not always find the optimal shelter in all cases.
